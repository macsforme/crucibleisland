//////////////////////////////// INTRODUCTION /////////////////////////////////

Crucible Island is a first-person shooter tower defense game. The goal of the game is to defend your tower by shooting down missiles fired at you by enemy ships, and to accumulate as many points as possible. Crucible island is currently only available on Mac OS X 10.6 and up.

This game evolved out of the author's attempt to learn how to program 3D simulation using OpenGL. It has been in development in one form or another since March 2010. Crucible Island has been designed to be OpenGL 2.0 compatible, meaning that the game should run on most dedicated graphics cards made around or after 2006 (assuming full operating system and driver support for the required features), while allowing for the flexibility of modern shader-based drawing pipelines. While the author hopes players find the game enjoyable, the game began as and continues to be an exercise, experiment, and learning experience for implementing new graphical effects and techniques.

Although it has been primarily created by a single author, Crucible Island is free and open-source software. The source code is available on GitHub at the address at the top of this file.

////////////////////////// OBTAINING BINARY RELEASES //////////////////////////

Binary releases are made available through the Apple App Store, or through GitHub (https://github.com/macsforme/crucibleisland/releases).


//////////////////////////// OBTAINING SOURCE CODE ////////////////////////////

Crucible Island source code may be obtained by cloning the public GitHub repository (https://github.com/macsforme/crucibleisland.git). Development source code, which is stored in the master branch, should be considered unstable as it may contain new or experimental features as well as bug fixes and corrections to known issues, allowing you to preview how future releases may look or to assist with testing or development.


//////////////////////////// BUILDING FROM SOURCE /////////////////////////////

Crucible Island build project files are currently maintained for Mac OS X using the Xcode IDE version 4.2 or later with a deployment target of Mac OS X 10.6 (Xcode 3.2 may also work, but a bug in the Mac OS X 10.6 SDK in some versions requires that you add the directory "/Library/Frameworks/Frameworks" to your "Framework Search Paths" setting before building). Crucible Island has the following external dependencies:

* Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) 1.2
* FreeType 2

Crucible Island should build with the most current stable release for these libraries. If it does not, please create an issue on GitHub at https://github.com/macsforme/crucibleisland/issues and I will take a look.

The Xcode project file is set to look for required library files in certain locations. If you install them elsewhere, you will need to edit the project file.

To set up SDL, download the Mac OS X framework from http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php (make sure you select the latest SDL 1.2 build). Place the SDL.framework file in the /Library/Frameworks/ directory. Copy the corresponding SDLMain.h and SDLMain.m files into the Crucible Island source directory at src/platform/macosx/. These files are not tracked by version control as they must match the version of the SDL framework you have installed.

To set up FreeType 2, download the latest stable release from http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/ to your computer. SourceForge may suggest the latest version to download near the top of the screen.

When you have downloaded FreeType 2, execute the following commands (or appropriate alternatives, as desired) in a shell to build and install the software (substitute the appropriate version number in the filename):

# cd ~/Downloads
# tar -xf freetype-2.5.3.tar.bz2			(substitute correct version)
# sudo mv freetype-2.5.3 /usr/local/src/	(substitute correct version)
# rm freetype-2.5.3.tar.bz2					(substitute correct version)
# cd /usr/local/src/freetype-2.5.3			(substitute correct version)
# CFLAGS="-isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -arch i386 -arch x86_64" LDFLAGS="-isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -arch i386 -arch x86_64" ./configure --disable-shared --with-png=no	(substitute latest Mac OS X SDK version)
# CFLAGS="-isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -arch i386 -arch x86_64" LDFLAGS="-isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -arch i386 -arch x86_64" make	(substitute latest Mac OS X SDK version)
# sudo make install

Freetype 2 should now be installed where the Crucible Island Xcode project file can find it.

To build Crucible Island, open the file "crucible island.xcodeproj" in the source directory. Expand the "frameworks" group near the bottom of the files panel on the left, and verify that the files "SDL.framework," "libfreetype.a," and "libpng.a" are not shown in red text. This will show you that you installed the dependencies correctly. Press the keys Command-B, or select "Build" from the Product menu, to build the project. When you activate the Utilities pane (using the icon in the upper-right corner of the Xcode window) and click on the "Crucible Island.app" in the Navigator pane, the full path to the application bundle should be shown in the Utilities pane.


///////////////////////////////// BUG REPORTS /////////////////////////////////

I would love to hear of any issues or bugs you encounter when using this game so I can correct them. Please bring up any problems on the issue tracker (https://github.com/macsforme/crucibleisland/issues). If the game has crashed, you should get a notice that the application quit unexpectedly. Please click "Report..." and on the following prompt click "Show Details" (please DO NOT click "Send to Apple"). Please copy the entire output under "Problem Details and System Configuration," and include this at the bottom of your issue report. This will help me tremendously when I try to determine what caused the problem and attempt to reproduce it.


////////////////////////////////// COMMENTS ///////////////////////////////////

I intend to be receptive to any suggestions and constructive criticism you may have to offer. I may often be reached via IRC on the FreeNode network (I go by Constitution). Figuring out my e-mail address is not difficult and is left as an exercise to the reader.

Thank you for your interest in this game. I hope you find it enjoyable.
