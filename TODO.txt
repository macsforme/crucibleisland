SHORT TERM:
* auto texture coordinates needs to be fixed
* fix opengl version test in compatibility.cpp
* should probably go through ALL files (especially Texture.cpp) and replace LOG_FATAL with LOG_INTERNALERROR as needed (or disable LOG_INTERNALERROR entirely?)
* go through source (especially Texture.cpp) and determine where uint8_t stuff should be replaced

LONG TERM:
* make the renderer use VBOs rather than individual commands
* set up GUI boxes with persistant dimensions and blending
* fix height in fontmanager... does the newline have a y-advance?

CONTEMPLATIONS:
* still not convinced that font glyph spacing is right... everything looks condensed unless using bold fonts
* do we need LOG_INTERNALERROR at all? maybe better just to crash... lots of unused code
* consider going through all code and changing widths, heights to vector2's
* GUI text arrangement needs to be re-thought out
* look into freetype glyph vertical orientation... is it read upside-down necessitating a vertical flip?
* consider fixing screen orientation so that upper-left is proper 0, 0 and lower right is dimX, dimY
* maybe fix all the backwards rotation in the HUD container shader?
